Open a terminal window and type these commands at the Linux command line - you shouldn't see any errors:

hdfs dfs -ls /            -- View the contents of the top-level directory in HDFS
hdfs dfs -ls              -- View the contents of your user directory (likely empty)
hdfs dfs -mkdir myNewDir  -- Create a new directory named ‘myNewDir’ in your user directory
hdfs dfs -ls              -- Verify that you now have a directory called ‘myNewDir’
hdfs dfs -rm -r myNewDir  -- Remove directory ‘myNewDir’
hdfs dfs -ls              -- Verify that you successfully removed ‘myNewDir’
hdfs dfs -mkdir funny_input                           -- Create a new directory
hdfs dfs -put cs_fun.txt funny_input                  -- Put your file into HDFS
hdfs dfs -cat funny_input/cs_fun.txt                  -- Output the contents of your HDFS file
cat cs_fun.txt                                        -- Output the contents of your local file



-- Get the file from HDFS and store it locally into new_copy_from_hdfs.txt: 
hdfs dfs -get funny_input/cs_fun.txt new_copy_from_hdfs.txt

cat new_copy_from_hdfs.txt -- View the new local version of the file 
diff cs_fun.txt new_copy_from_hdfs.txt -- The two files should be the same
